    <h1>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</h1>
    <h2>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!
        "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls,
        just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</h2>
    <p><strong>I hope I didn't brain my damage.</strong> <em> Old people don't need companionship.</em> They need to be
        isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal
        use.</p>
    <h3>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun.</h3>

            Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies?
            For
            fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound
            effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. The Internet King? I wonder if he could

            faster nudity…</p>

        honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Your guilty consciences may make you
        vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and
        rule you like a king!</h5>
